This is my personal site (third version). I remake this using Next.js + Typescript + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

But if you also find this template is useful, you also can use it. And of course, I'm open to any feedback. You can fork or clone this repo and make a PR here if you have some idea.
